New name for project: beat laboratory 


- The tapping with the keyboard sucks. Definitely need to switch to the mouse clicks for desktop
- click and drag to put into a new spot?
- need to add onclick
- need to figure out how to stop *open hi-hat* when you hit *close hi hat*. Also add a close when you lift a finger off the close hi-hat (so you can do a drag effect)
- dang it, I'm gonna add the keyboard back in lol
